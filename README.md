# Skips-Portfolio

## Deployed Portfolio: https://skip1113.github.io/Skips-Portfolio/

This is a single page portfolio that is built from HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. 
The vision for this portfolio was to be able to create and show design and asethetics. When studying to become a Full-stack Developer, 
I grew an immence passion for Font-end and UI/UX design. Being able to be inspired by so many amazing applications and code art to show my 
creativity is astounding. I enjoy the endless possibilities, challenges, and knowledge.

Please feel free to take a glance through some of my projects. Any feedback is much appreciated.
